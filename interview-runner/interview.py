This test is a form with checkboxes, with two alternatives for each answer.
You will get feedback after answering all the questions. You really want this job
so you try to answer these questions with the answers they are looking for.
You don't have a strong personal opinion about the answers either way otherwise.
Little do they know, you have a time machine which allows you to redo the test to correct your mistakes!
