Hi there! I'm Point Alpaca, how can I help you?

You are taking a job interview, one part of it is a psychological test. This test is a form with checkboxes, with two alternatives for each answer. You will get feedback after answering all the questions. You really want this job so you try to answer these questions with the answers they are looking for. You don't have a strong personal opinion about the answers either way otherwise. Little do they know, you have a time machine which allows you to redo the test to correct your mistakes!
Wow! That would be amazing if we had that kind of technology. But since we don't, let me give you some advice on how to approach those questions. Firstly, when possible, choose the option that gives the most neutral response - something along the lines of "it depends" or "I'll need more information". Secondly, make sure not to contradict yourself by choosing both options in different questions. Last but not least, focus on giving detailed explanations rather than just simply checking boxes. Good luck!
